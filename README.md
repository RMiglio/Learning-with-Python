# Learning-with-Python

Two years ago, during the pandemic, I learn python as my first programming language. Even tho I know the basic sintaxis and commands, I believe there is more that I can learn. Somebody who is dear to me just picked up this PL, so what better way to review the old concepts and learn new ones for my own works. Plus, teaching someone you care for on somehting you now is rewarding.
